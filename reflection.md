#Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a webpage where the user can input an address and be able to find the closest BMTA station.

The project contains two parts, the underlying logestics for the function, and the web page development. The first part, the logestics, can be found under code_MBTA.py. It first takes in an address and returns the coordinates using MAPQUEST. The coordinates is then used as input into the next functions where the closest MBTA stations are displayed. The second part of the project is to develop a webpage as a user interface where the user can input the street, city, and state they are in, and it will diplay the closest MBTA station info. The user interface website is http://127.0.0.1:5000/home

#Project Reflection 

For the project, the team did well in getting the logestics done quickly. The website was a challenge and we do believe that with more time and more research we can do more. We tried to find a way to add a google maps link on the output for the user, so the user can be directed from the output. However this proved difficult and we were not able to get it to work properly. This took lots of time for us, where we could've spent the time on improving the looks of the web page. 

The team worked very well together. We decided to meet up to work together at the same time. We devided the work up with Peter and Leo working on the logestics and Thomas working on the web page development. However we quickly realised that the logestics was easier than the website part, so after finishing up the logestics all three of us worked on the website. For the website part we also divided up the work, where Peter worked on the app.py part, Leo and Thomas looked at the index and did research on any problems we had.
