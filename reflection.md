# Reflection: Web App Development - MBTA Helper
### Benji Funk, Maria Herwagen, Callum Nicholson

## Project Overview

This project consists of a website that takes a location input of anywhere in Boston from the user and returns a nearby MBTA stop and whether that stop is wheelchair accessible. The input can be an address or a name of a place in Boston, such as "Prudential Center, Boston". The user will usually need to specify the city by adding ", Boston" to their request. If they fail to do so, an error message will remind them. The website also shows the closest nearby event with the venue name and Ticketmaster link for information.

## Reflection
### 1. Process

Our project's scope was definitely appropriate. We were able to work fast without being overwhelmed, which provided us with plenty of time and motivation for testing throughout the assignment. We planned to work quickly on the first part of the project, so we would have plenty of time before the deadline to address any challenges or try out optional parts. Thankfully, everything went smoothly, so we were able to attempt and implement an optional Ticketmaster API to show a closeby event near the location on the date that the user accesses the website. One part of the project that we did not anticipate taking so much time is the reading and figuring out of the API and Flask documentation. Going forward, for our final project, we will plan more time for our coding, so we can make sure to become familiar with the documentation throughout our process.

### 2. Team Work

We had one group meeting where we aligned on the scope of the project and split up the assignment for individual work. We planned it out by when the different group members could work on the project, with the first person setting up the APIs and getting the data, the second person finishing the data extraction and the return function, and the third person setting up the Flask code for the website. We made sure to do plenty of commits and testing as we were going, with other team members checking the part they weren't working on as it was done. This process allowed us to do a lot of testing to make sure that our code was working in multiple user environments.

Once we felt confident in our work for the required part, we decided to attempt an optional addition of the Ticketmaster API. We recognized that we had practiced our respective tasks between the API calls and the flask integration, so we used those skills to our advantage and distributed the work accordingly. We made sure to continue to do lots of testing. Even though we weren't able to have more group meetings due to schedule differences, we communicated over WhatsApp, which allowed us to address concerns. In the future, we'd love to plan better for more group meetings in order to try pair programming. Dividing the work definitely worked, but we feel that we could benefit from problem solving together.
