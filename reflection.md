## 2. Team Work

We had one group meeting where we aligned on the scope of the project and split up the assignment for individual work. We planned it out by when the different group members could work on the project, with the first person setting up the APIs and getting the data, the second person finishing the data extraction and the return function, and the third person setting up the Flask code for the website. We made sure to do plenty of commits and testing as we were going, with other team members checking the part they weren't working on as it was done. 

Could probably say more about the extra feature here if we end up doing it.
