# Project Wrap-up
**Angelina Cho and Kotaro Yabe**

## Project Overview
Write a short abstract describing your project. Include all the extensions to the basic requirements.

## Project Reflection
1. From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? What self-studying did you do? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?
2. Also discuss your team process in your reflection. How did you plan to divide the work (e.g. split by module/class, always pair program together, etc.) and how did it actually happen? Were there any issues that arose while working together, and how did you address them? What would you do differently next time?
