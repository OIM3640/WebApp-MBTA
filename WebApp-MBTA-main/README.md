# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

# Assignment 3
### Keydell Fuller and Richard Speiss

For this assignment, we are instructed to create a program that would take in a location within the greater Boston area and then return the nearest MBTA stop. The program would display in a browser using Flask and be run using Python code. Part of the assignment included adding additional details to make the program more interesting. We decided to add a map that showed the location of the stop. We also added the relative temperature in the greater Boston area.

### Team Work 
Before starting the project, we met in class to discuss what the overall project goals were and what we had to do as a team. We were able to notice that the project was already divided up into 3 parts, so we each did 1.5 parts, having split up part 3. This made the workload more approachable. Having divided the work, we were able to put more effort into our particular parts, thus creating a far better result than we would have working independently. If we were to do this project again, finishing the project earlier would help. If we had finished a day or two before the due date, we could have used that leftover time to further expand on the results.

### Learnings 
This project was a great chance for us to learn how to work together in preparation for the term project, which will include us working together on a bit larger of a scale. We learned how to both work on the same repository as well as how to lean on one another for help. We can use our learnings to better time manage ourselves for the next project. In terms of the use of ChatGPT, we used it mainly to check our code after not being able to use our terminal and normal debugging methods. ChatGPT could read through our code and find small typo edits in variables, for example.
