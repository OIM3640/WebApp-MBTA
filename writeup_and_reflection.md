# Web App Development - MBTA Helper by Alan Xian and Maciej Czapnik

## Project Overview:

We have created a simple text based MBTA Helper, a web application that finds the closest MBTA station to the location provided by the user.

[x] Upon visiting the index page at http://127.0.0.1:5000/, the user will be greeted by a page that says hello, and includes an input form that requests a place name.
[x] Upon clicking the 'Submit' button, the data from the form will be sent via a POST request to the Flask backend at the route POST /nearest
[x] (Optional) Perform some simple validation on the user input. See wtforms.
[x] The Flask backend will handle the request to POST /nearest_mbta. Then your app will render a mbta_station page for the user - presenting nearest MBTA stop and whether it is wheelchair accessible. In this step, you need to use the code from Part 1.
[x] If something is wrong, the app will render a simple error page, which will include some indication that the search did not work, in addition to a button (or link) that will redirect the user back to the home page.

## Project Reflection:

-

- I believe this project gave us a great idea of where do we stand as a team and what do we have to improve on to be successful with our term project. With this assignment we have been a little chaotic and didn't divide the work very clearly. Fixing that will allow us to be more productive and efficient, write more and better functions easier. Next time we will definitely meet in person and few days ahead of the deadline to avoid last minute issues.
