# WebApp-MBTA - Immanuel & Arman
 This is the base repository for Web App Development project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 
##
### Project Overview
We created a website that can take any location within Massachusetts as an input and output the nearest MBTA train station (as long as one exists within 1/2 a mile). To accomplish this, we utilized the Flask library, the MBTA API, and the MAPBOX API. We needed to build a basic landing page that used (form) to retrieve an argument, use MAPBOX functions to gather the location data, and MBTA functions to find corresponding stations.

### Reflection
Building the web pages using Flask was straightforward and similar to what we did during class. We struggled initially with getting the APIs to work correctly but found the provided project outline instrumental and helped us continue on.

An issue we discovered early on when trying to split up the work was the data corruption that would occur when we both attempted to pull and push the same documents from GitHub. We looked to the "live server" extension to solve this issue but struggled to get that up and working. Ultimately, we had to edit separate documents, copy and & paste between them, and meet in person to upload them to GitHub from Immaneul's computer. Immanuel was the mastermind behind our beautiful-looking web page, and Arman worked closely with the APIs and corresponding functions. In the end, we worked on both parts of the project and mostly pulled our info from our in-class session examples and ChatGPT.

ChatGPT was super helpful with navigating the API-specific functions. We used it extensively when we hit roadblocks and have linked our dialogue below. This project helped us learn the intricacies of pulling data from API servers and reinforced the FLASK and API-calling-specific proficiencies we developed during class.
