## Project Overview
This project is about the development of a web application design to locate the nearest MBTA station to the user's choice of address. We build the application using Python and Flask,and the MapBox and MBTA API'S for geolocation and transit data. The appliplication allows the user to enter an address and then displays the nearest MBTA station along with its the status if the station is wheelchair accessible or not.
