# Project Overview

My project consists of using MapBox API, MBTA API, and Open Weather Map API. I used these
API's to track the users location and give them weather updates when they see the second
page of the web application. In order to create my web application, I had to import and run
Flask. I wanted to dive more into how to do html on VSCode, so I watched videos on how to
format the website which is why I have so many points and numbers in my index.html code.
Because I wanted this project to actually be useful for people I learned how to make it look
more asthetically pleasing.

# Reflection
I worked on this project alone so I didn't have any extra minds to collaborate with. Though
it came to an advantage style wise as I was able to decorate and create my web application
the way I wanted to. Although most of my code is written in python, I wanted to build more off
the html we learned in class. Like how to create more professional looking websites with colors
and formatting and things like that. For me I wanted my website to have the colors I liked so I 
attached a photo of the first page below:

Because I did work on this alone it was more challenging to create the files, figure 
out how to make the website look prettier and other things like that. Though that 
does not mean I was not able to complete the project. I was able to sucessfully have my
code run and my web application looks really nice compared to the stuff we did in class. 
I had great assistance from ChatGPT mainly because I was really unsure of how to run my app 
file. I ran into a super big issue in the beginning working with my project, I created a
mbta_helper folder and put my mbta_helper.py, config.py, and app.py under one file. 

At first I thought it would be the only way I could get the mbta_helper.py function, but I 
asked ChatGPT if it's a possibility my app.py function isn't working is because I have them 
all under the same file. After moving some things around and finding a import to put in my app.py 
I was then able to run my code. But my main issue was figuring out how to get my token and api key.
I'm more familiar of using API's with MongoDB and SQL/JSON, so figuring out how to find my token
and API's were really difficult. At one point the API key that I was given when registering on MBTA API 
website was not allowing the web page to run. So I had to request for a new key and I had to wait a 
few days for it which was a bit stressful. Overall I would say the easiest part was creating and writing
my index and results code. The most challenging part was ensuring I created the proper functions in my
mbta_helper.py so my app.py could run smoothly and thankfully I was able to ask thoughtful questions
to ChatGPT while also learning about the errors I made/how to avoid it.
