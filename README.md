# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

# Project Overview
In this project, I used MAPBOX and MBTA APIs to identify the nearest MBTA station for a given location. The project comprises two sections: program functionality and website interactivity and visualization. Within the program functionality section, I performed a significant amount of exception handling to improve my code. I also adapted previous code to determine the weather temperature of the location in question. I initially created code to find exceptions in the website section but removed this code after improving the functionality section. As an additional component, I spent time stylizing the individual webpages using the CSS built into HTML with notable additions such as online images for each page (I decided not to use a CSS file due to design dissimilarity among the HTML files and convenience).

# Reflection
I found the scaffolding provided in the `nearest_mbta file` to benefit the modularity of my project. When I begin coding, I often like to start coding immediately and identify and fix any roadblocks that prevent success. This often has the unintended consequence of resulting in less modular code, so the structured approach encouraged me to consider the bigger picture immediately. Regarding testing, I tested several instances that I thought would cause an error and implemented code to prevent these exceptions incrementally. Overall, I thought the general process of coding went relatively smoothly. I am somewhat perplexed by the fact that locations that have a space in the name, for instance, `West Roxbury`, do not cause a problem, given that I did not have to create a particular exception rule for this.

I worked alone on this project. I typically attempt to complete all the code in one very long session and then review it over the following days. I completed the program section in one session, then worked for two sessions to complete the website component due to confusion regarding the POST method. In retrospect, I should have spent more time reading the research links provided rather than trying to code immediately; I spent a very long time trying to figure out how to transfer information from Python flask and HTML.

Within this project, I increased my understanding of the flask library, API integration, and the POST method. A better understanding of API integration and data visualization through websites will greatly benefit my personal and business objectives, given the value of process automation. Many of the insights within this Assignment will also benefit my Final Project, particularly the API and data visualization components. I attempted to leverage ChatGPT for learning assistance during moments of confusion but found myself gravitating toward big-picture documentation online. Though I could ask ChatGPT to provide a bigger picture, I often find that existing documentation on the Internet furthers my understanding more comprehensively.
