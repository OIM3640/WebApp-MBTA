# 1. Project Overview

The project aimed to create a simple web application using Flask, integrating functionalities to find the nearest MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) stop based on a user-provided place name or address. The application utilizes the Mapbox Geocoding API to obtain the coordinates of the input location and the MBTA API to find the nearest MBTA stop. The Flask web framework was employed to create a user-friendly interface with two main pages: a search page to input the location and a result page displaying the nearest MBTA stop and its wheelchair accessibility status.

# 2. Reflection

1. Judging from the results, the project was not successful. I don't think my code runs smoothly. But looking at the process, I think I learned a lot such as creating functions for API interactions and designing the Flask app, helped streamline the development process.

2. Solo working.

3. From a learning perspective, this project provided insights into combining various technologies to create a functional web application. Understanding API documentation, handling JSON responses, and structuring a Flask app were valuable skills gained. ChatGPT played a significant role in generating code snippets and guiding the implementation process. Looking forward, a deeper understanding of testing practices and improved error handling would be beneficial for future projects.
