# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for MBTA project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

Project Overview:
In the project, we attempted to create a website where you can enter the location andit will retrun the nearest MBTA station. We first utilized API keys in Mapquest to get the longitude and latitude of the place entered. We then get information on all the subway stations through MBTA. Using these sources of information, we then create a function that will return the nearest MBTA station based on the longitude and latitude of the place entered. This is used to run the app file that creates our website. The html files help customize our website. 

Project Reflection:
After a little bit of trouble shooting, we were able to successfully build a function that would give us the nearest station based on place entered. We do believe however that our website could be improved as we had difficulty building that and getting that to work the way we wanted. We believe that we had a good plan for testing as we were able to efficiently troubleshoot our functions in the mbta_helper file. It did take some self studying to import the config function. We hope to utilize what we have learned here for future endeavors down the line. For example pulling data via api keys is something that we can see us doing later on. It is agreed by both of us that knowing html would have been nice before doing this project as building the app would've been easier. 

Our plan was to meet and work together to finish the assignment. It was up to us individually to figure out whether we want to try troubleshooting issues on our own. We were able to execute this plan and believe it worked well for us. This way of working will probably continue during our final project.
