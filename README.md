# WebApp-MBTA

## Team member

## Project Overview
This project is to build a website that allows users to find the nearest MBTA station and whether the station is accessible or not. The first part of this project is the mbta_helper, which includes several functions that enable downloading data from map and mbta, finding longitude and latitude for a place, and eventually finding the nearest MBTA station and its accessibility according to the place name the user enters. The second part of this project is to create a user interface, through several html templates and the functions in app.py. 

## Project Reflection 
From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? What self-studying did you do? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?

What went well:
1. Our project is appropriately scoped. We wrote the steps we need to do according to the requirements listed on the instruction.
2. We have a good plan for unit testing. We test every unit seperately before using it in the last function to make sure every function works well individually.

What self-studying did we do:
1. We read the documentation of Flask and try to implement some of the things we read into the projects.
2. We read the extra links provided for creating html forms on the instruction.

Team work process:
We plan to divide the work by part 1 (Geocoding) and part 2 (web app). But eventually we find out that we will encounter bugs when we are doing parts individually, so we eventually work collaboratively on the same part, helping each other to debug and solve problems. We use seperate files to record our work so we can compare our work and make sure we don't accidentally erase each other's work, and we combine the works to one file in the end. We work remotely, and one problem with that is the changes we make don't reflect simultaneously in our visual code. We have to pull from Github and refresh to see the changes each other makes. Maybe we will think about working in person next time.
