# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repository for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

### 1. Discuss the process point of view, including what went well and what could be improved. Provide reflections on topics such as project scoping, testing, and anything else that could have helped the team succeed.

Overall this project/ assignment was really fun to work on and really adds onto my knowledge from WebTech and combining both the back end and front end. It was great to make something that went belong a static website that was able to give real time results from using data from an API. I think starting off it was a lot to scope out and took time for me to go through the logic aspect of it in terms of retrieving the data from the API and working with Flask. How I broke down the project was getting the code on mbta_helper working first and making sure that the link between the API and Keys were working. Then moving to the app aspect with copying the code over and for me was a bit of plug and play experience with a lot of trouble shooting from my HTML pages not linking to the data from the API not working. The longest part for me was testing everything out and there is still more room to improve on it. 

### 2. Discuss your team's work division, including how the work was planned to be divided and how it actually happened. Address any issues that arose while working together and how they were addressed. Finally, discuss what you would do differently next time.

In terms of the coding I tried my best with doing small parts throughout the weekend in order to save my future self some time and less of a headache. Also as I mentioned before breaking it done with the backend linking aspect first and then doing the front end a seperate time. As always I need to improve on my time management and I feel like the assignment just seemed difficult at first galance in terms of the different parts. But after starting on it, I felt it was more managable and easier to work with than previously thought. Next time spend more time on the code and maybe go to office hours with some of the issues that I have which might/ really would save me some time.

### 3. Discuss from a learning perspective, what you learned through this project and how you'll use what you learned going forward. Reflect on how ChatGPT helped you and what you wish you knew beforehand that could have helped you succeed. Consider including screenshots to demonstrate your project's progress and development.

What I learned from this project is really learning how to use Flask which is super fun and creating my own web app which I never thought I could do this semester. I was fun to see the Python code in a different format and in a website that works functionally. Great time connecting the front end aspect which I have always enjoyed and visualizing the API data in a website. This has really inspired me to think about other applications of how I can use Flask and maybe start my own website during the winter for fun. For the most part I went to ChatGPT when ever I can into error codes and a lot of the time it was small mistakes that I could not find in Visual Studio or mistakes in Flask such as not puting the HTML pages in the Templates folder. It was really asking for help with troubleshooting and for a second opinion if I wasn't sure my code was working ocrrectly. I wish I went over some of my CSS and HTML knowledge beforehand since I forgot some of the small syntaxes and keywords which made me asking Google or going to W3Schools for help.
