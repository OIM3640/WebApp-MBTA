# WebApp-MBTA Project Writeup and Reflection

- Luna Dayan
- Juanse Arosemena

## Project Overview
This project is about the development of a web application design to locate the nearest MBTA station to the user's choice of address. We build the application using Python and Flask,and the MapBox and MBTA API'S for geolocation and transit data. The appliplication allows the user to enter an address and then displays the nearest MBTA station along with its the status if the station is wheelchair accessible or not. Furthermore, we added two perks to this app, on one side we changed the color of the wheelchair accessible output (yes or no) to green and red as a nice detail. On the other side, we added the distance of the nearest MBTA station to our location by utilizing the haversine formula and the functiond neaded from the math library.

## Reflection
### Process
We created a web app to locate the nearest MBTA station using Python, Flask, MapBox, and MBTA APIs. Flask provided flexibility, and MapBox and MBTA APIs gave us geolocation and transit data. User-friendly touches like color-coded indicators for wheelchair accessibility and Haversine formula for distance calculation boosted the project appeal. However, we could improve the user interface and error handling for better user interactions. The site is not the prettiest one out there. 

### Team's work division
Although we did divided the work, we mostly worked together either in person or on facetime. The only issue that arose was having one of us attend the others class as we have different schedules, however I (Juanse) compromised and went to her class time which gave us time to work together in person. Luna is definitely profitient in Flask, so she lead that aspect of the project. However we were both always involved in the decision making of the team. An example being choosing the wow element in which we both agread that it would be usefull to add the distance specially in KM. The only thing we would do different in the future would be working more in person and sincronozing our push/pulls to github as on a few ocasions, we overwrote eachother.

### Learning perspective
The project provided a valuable learning experiences,as it allowed us to experience the process of using external APIs, understanding geospatial calculations through the Haversine formula, and recognizing the importance of UI. ChatGPT was helpfull for error-solving and generating ideas during the development process.
