# WebApp-MBTA
Project Brief
This project was relatviely challenging, but at the same time, was rewarding. Through this project, we were able to build an extremely useful website which has genuine real-world applications. We were also actually able to see the results of all our functions. Using HTML was also very exciting since there were so many opportunities to choose from and so many different functions to use. HTML is extremely user-friendly and allows us to custom make any webpage easily, according to the function of the webpage. For this project, we made a web page that shows the closest MBTA station to the address entered on the website and tells the user if this location is wheelchair accessible or not. We used 2 different API's to allow us to find the latitude and longitude of a particular location( converting words into numbers) and to show us the location of various MBTA stations. We experimented with the HTML functions and added images, changed image size, changed font size, added a button, changed font color etc. We even included an error handler which took care of a situation in which the address entered did not have an MBTA station close to it. In that case, an error.html page would show up which simply prompts the user to enter another address. 

In the project we found debugging to be the hardest challenge. In the Mbta_helper we kept getting an error regarding the urlib library. We were not able to find any solutions online and after hours of trying it on our own we consulted the professor who showed us how the dubugging process works. We were ashamed of our trivial mistake and have learnt a lot from the experience. We were able to utilize our debugging knowledge in our html code and that saved us a lot of time. 

For this project, our team worked very smoothly. We first read the entire project guideline, then decided on how to divide the work. Shaan was responsible for the HTML work (MBTA_Helper form, MBTA result form and Error) and the app.py and Priyavrat was responsible for finding the URL's and API's and writing the mbta_helper function. The project went smoothly since we completed our work exactly according to how we planned it. We did end up running into a few problems during our work. For our problems, we first consulted each other for problems and were able to solve most issues. If we were unable to solve our own issues, we consulted the professor and searched online and were finally able to solve all our issues. Going ahead, we would probably like to dive deeper into the opportunities of HTML and use different API's to make even more useful webpages.
