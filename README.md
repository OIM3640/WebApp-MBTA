# WebApp-MBTA

This is a self assignment. Member: Marissa Yang.

## Project Overview

The project aims at building an app to help user find closest MBTA station along with some information like whether wheelchair is avaliable, arrival and departure time. The web page ask user to enter a location place and redirect use to another rendered page with the desired result. If any error happen, users will be redirected to an error page where they can make the recision to click the button to take them back to home page. Additionally, I added pictures of each page and user WeatherMAP and Ticketmaster API to show the local weather in both Fahrenheit and Celsius and the top 5 nearby event along with more information about events nearby.

## Reflection (3 sections)

### Process point of view

Coding the html was relatively smooth for me before including the form. I encountered major hinderance when trying to import the submitted place name to the app.py and try to redirect user to a new page where results would be displayed. Initially, I thought both result and home page should be in the same html, and with this thought comes alot of failed attempts to render the web app. I check the class note where professor showed how to post the registered classes after registration and created a seperate html instead. I also tried to ask user for username and password, but the function User remains undefined and I had difficulty understanding the website material which consumes me alot of time. In the future, I would probably review class materials first before coding to get more pellucid logic of how the program would go. Additionally, since the process is not well documented from the begining, I constantly have to revisite previous codes and add and delete codes with adds more burden from my side. In the future, I need to carefully plan out the functions I need prior to start working on the web app to avoide duplicative work load.

### Work devision

This homework is a solo assignment. I divided the work into sections like coding the function, the web app, and the result webapp and coded some blocks of code each day. This spreads the workload over a longer periods of time and allow myself to take some time to reflect on code I already coded where I am able to find areas for improvement. However, this also means that I might forget the already coded function and need to revisit them constantly before starting on new codes. Next time I might consider taking note each day what I have accomplished and set plans for what needs to be done in the future on paper to make the workflow more clear.

### Learning

One issue I experienced with ChatGPT is that they don't quite understand the file structure of the respository so the code they render don't always work and if not noted of this mistake, it might take me hours trying to figure how why the web app won't render. Additionally, ChatGPT sometimes have trouble understanding the relationships between files and might confuse the code from one file to another. ChatGPT does help me with explaining new topics like how to handle error in web app and redirect back to homepage and how to leave a blank line between lines of texts. Additionally, I find ChatGPT really helpful when helping me understand complicated data structures like it is the case with ticketmaster API where the information is overloaded. But after ChatGPT interpretated the information for me, I tried to revisit and understand the structure again to make sure I know what information I obtained. ChatGPT is also very helpful when I try to make my hmtl looks prettier with css. I asked ChatGPT to help generate a better looking web interface with interactive features like bouncing images and enlarged pictures when hovering over the button.
