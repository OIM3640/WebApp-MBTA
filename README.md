# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repository for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

This project entailed developing an advanced web application to locate the nearest MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) station based on a given place name. Utilizing Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework in Python, the application seamlessly integrates with Mapbox and MBTA APIs to fetch geographical data and transit information. Core features included place name input, nearest station identification, a responsive user interface, advanced error handling, and custom UI design.

This project was particularly enjoyable as it resulted in a visual product that allowed me to express my creativity, especially through CSS. It enabled me to deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS. For a more immersive experience, I created distinct HTML pages for each aspect of the application (home, error 404, station not found, and the results page), each featuring unique images, fonts, and backgrounds. Utilizing the APIs was straightforward due to their clear and comprehensive documentation. Initially, I encountered challenges in using Mapbox to obtain latitude and longitude, but these were overcome through online resources and assistance from ChatGPT.

One area for potential improvement is the implementation of a radius input feature. This would allow users, especially in areas like Babson, to adjust the search radius according to their willingness to travel farther to a station. Despite efforts, integrating this feature into the API link proved challenging, particularly in correctly adjusting the API for the mile radius.

Working solo on this project meant there was no division of labor.

The project significantly enhanced my skills in using Flask and CSS and improved my ability to work with various APIs. I learned how to parse JSON data effectively and solidified my knowledge of HTML and CSS through this project.
