# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 
# Project Overview
In this Web App Development Project, we created a MBTA helper. This helper helps users find the nearest MBTA stop and whether or not it is wheelchair accessible based off of their location. Additionally, we included the street name of the MBTA stop to give more clarity of where to find the stop. When the user enters the page, they will see the header in bold, which will catch their eye and will ask them to input their location. Under the text box is an image of the MBTA map with all the train and bus lines. We believe that by including this aspect, users are able to pinpoint the general idea of this app.
