# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

 ## Project Overview 
 In this project I used Flask to create a web application that takes an input from the user about their current location and returns the closest MBTA stop. It also tells whether the stop is wheelchair accessible or not. Along with that I also added a feature where it tells the weather at the stop. 

 ## Reflection
 For this project I used chat GPT as little as I could. I decided to learn to write this code from other sources like YouTube. The first thing I learned was how to use APIs properly and this solved most my issues. In terms of scope, I really enjoyed most of this project once I got the hang of it. I believe my decision to not use chat GPT made the project go well. I was doing this project alone, and I would not have done it any other way. I think the main reason for that is that I could actually learn a lot.
