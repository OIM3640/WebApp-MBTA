## Project Overview
This project uses APIs provided by MapQuest and the MBTA to return the closest transit station and whether it is wheelchair accessible when provided with a location input by the user. The first step was to interface with the MapQuest API to return coordinates when given a location, which was then used as an input for the MBTA API to return the station nearest to those coordinates along with its wheelchair accessibility information. This data is displayed by the result.html page. Pulling coordinate data from the MapQuest API and linking the outputs of each function to the next functions that used them as inputs were the most time consuming and difficult part of the project. 

## Project Reflection
The things that went well in this project was our team chemistry and how focused we were on it. Because the assignment was more structured, we felt like we had more confidence in our working and were able to make constant progression. This made us believe that this project was more appropriately scoped than the second assignment. However, it was difficult to connect the code to the webpage as at certain times we felt lost as to what we should do. Because of this difficulty, we were forced to self-study and search for solutions on forums and youtube to come up with a solution. One thing both of us wish we knew before starting this assignment is knowing more about how to create a webpage.
 
Overall, our team experience seemed flawless and both of us worked together really well. At first, we planned to divide each segment of the code assignment for us to work on individually, but since it was difficult to run the program with incomplete or non-updated parts of the code, we thought it would be beneficial to work together on one machine instead. This turned out to be a great decision as we were able to teach and explain parts of the assignment that each of us did not understand to each other. There werenâ€™t any prevalent issues aside from the fact that we had to work together on one machine for it to be most effective, but we soon adapted to that. Because everything went so well, I only hope that we can work this well together for our other project.
