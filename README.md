# Project Overview
This project's purpose is to build a website that will allow people to find a nearby MBTA station and provide the current weather of the location. The website will request the user to input a location. If the input is valid, the site will bring the user to a new page that displays the nearby station and the weather of the provided location. However, if the user provides any irrelevant inputs such as a string of numbers or a random string of letters, it will bring them to an error page. This error page will have a message redirecting them to go back to the home page and provide a new input. To build this website, we will combine three APIs together: MapBox API, MBTA API, and OpenWeather API. 

# 2. Reflection
## 1. *Process* POV
During the development of mbta_helper, we initially encountered an issue with retrieving the correct latitude and longitude coordinates in the get_lat_lng() function. The function consistently returned "None", indicating that the response data was empty. To address this issue, we attempted to refine our query by adding an additional filter to the URL called "radius", set to a value of 1000. However, this adjustment inadvertently exacerbated the problem, as we consistently received the same output regardless of the latitude and longitude inputs. Upon further investigation, we identified that the root cause of the issue was within the get_lat_lng() function itself. Originally, the function returned a tuple variable where latitude was mistakenly assigned as longitude, and longitude as latitude. By correcting this ordering and adjusting the output type to string, we were able to resolve the issue and ensure the correct functioning of the code. As both of us are trying to debug and push the code at the same time on GitHub, it is very inefficient because we both need to adapt to the changes made by the other person.Therefore, we kept one error code as test.py and the corrected version as mbta_helper.py. Keeping two versions of the code in different files from the begginning of this project would have helped accelerate this debugging process. 
## 2. Our Work Division
We originally planned to work separately, working whenever we are personally free because we both have very busy schedules. This usually leaves us with little shared time we can sit down together to work considering one of us also lives off-campus, and it would not be safe to call an Uber extremely late at night. However, we found a complication with this working method. Due to lack of communication of when we are working on the project and what part of the project we are working on, we often have conflict messages when fetching origin and pull each otherâ€™s work to our laptops.  

Therefore, to address this problem, we realized we should be clearer on how we split the parts. For example, Yuefan would write the code for the first three functions and Jade would write the last function and a new function for the extension. We also split up the app.py and the html work. Yuefan would write the app.py and Jade would write the html and CSS code to design the website because Jade has a strong interest in website designing. Another solution we implemented is to stay on call with each other while working to allow both of us to smoothly work simultaneously together and have quick access to each other. This is to substitute working together in the same setting. With the solutions implemented, our work process was much better, helping to eliminate the issue of overlapping work.  

We believe this was a good learning process for what worked well when working together between us, providing a precedent for our group project. Next time, we would start by clearly dividing our work and ensuring that we have clear communication. We found communication is very important when collaborating on Python code.
