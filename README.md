# ** WebApp-MBTA **
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

## 1. Project Overview 

Our project consists of utilizing the MapBox API, MBTA API, and Open Weather Map API to capture information based on the user's input of location. We used flask to create a webpage that allows a user to input a city or address and click submit. It will then direct them to a page showing the nearest MBTA stop as well as if it is wheelchair accessible and the current weather! We have also added visual effects to our web page and even made the headers move around the screen. 

## 2. Reflection 

The coding and capturing aspect of using API’s went well for us and was easy to implement and understand. It was a struggle at some moments to sort and pick the right list names in order to access the specific information that we wanted but it soon became easily doable. Something that we initially struggled with was the use of Flask and capturing the code from a different file. We eventually ended up putting all our base code in the same app.py file and that became a lot easier. In terms of project scoping, we decided to follow the rubric and then branch out once we had a solid foundation and understanding of the topics. When running into issues, we would add print statements in methods, debug, or utilize ChatGTP to find issues if we were genuinely really stuck. 

We had initially planned to both work on the code remotely but ran into a couple issues with github and the data not being able to be fetched properly. We ended up meeting in person and working on it together. Anika worked more on the coding and API side of things while Lilly utilized her knowledge from Webtech to aid in the Flask visualizations. However, all work was ultimately done and worked on with each other. There were not any issues that arose while working together. Next time, we would come to the professor earlier on for help to be able to guide us on how to better utilize github and be able to work on it remotely. 

We thought that this project helped us improve our problem solving skills when it comes to coding immensely, because there were four different files for us to work with and potentially run into problems with. When this occurred we had to work to figure out which file was having the issues and then, as stated above, add print statements, debug or use chatGPT or the professor if all else failed. We also got more comfortable with using API’s and integrating html within our python projects, which we know will be useful when it comes to our term project. We believe that having a more extensive background  knowledge of html/python integration and how to mix and match different APIs would have sped along our learning process and potentially allowed for a wider scope of our project. ChatGPT helped us when we got stuck and did not know how to move forward (having exhausted all other methods), so it worked as an in between step of being stuck and going to the professor. In these cases it helped debug our code when there were small mistakes that we had a hard time catching, for instance an extra “/” or referencing a variable or function by a slightly incorrect name (nearest_station versus nearest station).
