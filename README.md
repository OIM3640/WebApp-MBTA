# Assignment 3 Reflection

## Project Overview:

Throughout the development of this project, I felt like all the python skills I learned throughout the semester came together. The assignment was challenging but at the same time one of the most interesting programs I have developed. The program is an application designed for users to input a location and use it to extract the latitude and longitude of that location from MapQuest API. This information is extracted as a JSON file which can be used to easily locate the location to then look up in the MBTA API url what would be the closest train station. The information from MBTA would also be in a JSON format and included more information about the MTBA, like which stations are accessible by wheelchair. Essentially everything is put together using Flask to run the code on the web through some HTML pages. The app is coded to read the inputs of the user location and then return a results page that has all the information needed about the MTBA station nearest to that location.

## Project Reflection:

I would say that the process behind the development of this app went well. I started by creating the functions that would take the location information and would essentially return what would be the nearest station with information about wheelchair accessibility. These functions were built using previous knowledge of JSON files and being able to extract the requested information from them. After being done with the functions I began working on the front end. Essentially taken what we learned from last over the past weeks and created two HTML pages. One with a form taking the input of the user, and one to display the output as result. Testing was a constant measure throughout the development of the program. The first wit would involve each function, and going back to see why the output wasn't the desired one. Finally, it was about making the write connections between python and HTML to display the intended results on the web. I would say that we were prepared for the development of this assignment. With more time and some more self-studying, I would have liked to really be able to implement more features into the program. Things like showing the procure of the station with google maps, or even incorporating directs also through google maps would have been a very cool feature. But overall, this assignment has though me very useful skills on APIs and flask that I would definitely consider in my final project.

I worked on this assignment individually. I honestly don't regret working with a partner because I feel like this assignment helped me understand the topics very well but tried and error. I was able to use class examples to guide myself throughout the assignment and be able to complete it. The only reason why I would have done the team would have been to split more of the work. It was definitely an overwhelming amount of work and I feel like more time and even some help would have allowed me to improve the program to add some new cool features that would have made the app more unique. However, overall I think it went very well and I learned a lot from the assignment.
