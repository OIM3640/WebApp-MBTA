# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for Web App Developement project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

# Project Overview
In this project, we used different web APIs to process data in order to develop a web app using Flask. The two primary APIs we used are Mapbox and MBTA, which allow us to gather geographical as well as MBTA stops information in the Great Boston Area. The goal of the web app is to allow users to search for the nearest MBTA stop with the given place name or address. Users are also able to choose their preferred transportation mode or search for all types of transportation methods available. Additionally, the output would also provide information regarding wheelchair accessibility. Throughout the project, we will be exploring different MBTA API endpoints as well as experimenting with CSS to format and style our HTML website.

# Reflection
From a process point of view, our project is appropriately scoped as we were able to establish a website that meets our goal. We were also able to explore different possibilities using the MBTA APIs and include that in our web app. We also conducting testing where we tested our code and fixed any bugs in our program at every step to avoid any issues at the end. To further improve our project, we could search for other available APIs in order to add more available information for users. For example, we could incorporate nearby restaurants or events at the MBTA stops. Additionally, we could also inlcude more MBTA stop information to users such as arrival times to enrich our web app.
