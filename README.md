# WebApp-MBTA

Over the course of this project, I have not only continued to grow my knowledge base of how to use and implement APIâ€™s, but also learned the basics of how to implement and develop a flask app. Using the MBTA and MAPBOX APIs I was able to design several functions that ultimately would allow me to not only see the longitude and Latitude of the town, but also the closest MBTA station to those coordinates. Furthermore, my get_nearest_station function
returned whether or not the station was wheelchair accessible. The last major API I used was OpenWeather, which we experimented with in previous classes and let us access a trove of useful local weather data. Using these three APIs in conjunction with Flask, I was able to display helpful information via a url to my  program's users.

When it comes to this project, I really felt like I struggled. Using a flask for the first time I felt confused and honestly overwhelmed. As I got further into the project, I felt like I started to get a better understanding of the flask documentation, but even then I still didn't have much confidence. If I were to repeat this project, I would have spent more time over the weekend experimenting with Flask outside of the homework assignment. If I had done this, I believe I would have had a better understanding of the underlying syntax and would have been less stressed during the actual assignment.

From a team perspective I flew solo. While I am glad that I pushed myself to work and attack this problem on my own, it also caused me a lot of unneeded stress when I came up against problems in my code. Next time I think I will work harder to find a group. While I think that solving this problem on my own forced me to learn the subject, I also see the value of collaboration and learning from my peers.

I learned a lot throughout this process about URLs, web and app development, and html formatting. While I have become comfortable using APIs, app development such as what we did with flask is something I need to continue to work on. However, while this topic has been difficult to pick up, it has also opened my eyes to potential opportunities relating to developing  my own sites for entrepreneurial ventures. I look forward to continuing my Flask skills as I work on my final project.

In completing this project ChatGPT was instrumental. While I knew how to code many of the functions in python for the MBTA and MapBox APIs, the HTML was a bit past my knowledge level. By asking frequent questions on ChatGPT,  I was able to get functioning HTML code that made my flask site possible. I also used ChatGPT for much of the debugging I had to do. When I couldn't immediately figure out why my code was giving me an error message I would ask GPT if it could assist or knew where the error occurred. Overall I think this was a great first look at Flask and I look forward to continuing to hone my skills.
