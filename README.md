# Web App Assignment 3: Mark Sirazi and Ajay Subramanian 

## Project Overview 

In this project, our goal was to build a ##Web App## that functions as a tool for the user to find the closest MBTA station given their current location’s coordinates. To accomplish this, we used a backend **Python** program and a frontend **HTML/CSS**.  The Python program uses an API to extract the coordinates of all MBTA stations and then compares it to the user input on the Web App to find the closest MBTA station. The HTML/CSS program functions to create a website to take the user input and feed it through the Python Program and finally it displays the result. 

## Reflection 

### Process 

Our workflow was smooth and we dealt with error handling very well, using rubber ducky debugging throughout the entire process of writing the code. Our work was efficient and our strongest quality as a team was our ability to communicate and help each other when having difficulty. We attacked the project by going part by part to ensure that each component of our code functioned properly before moving on to the next function that needed to be implemented.  

### Work division 

We did not divide the work by parts, we divided the work in terms of roles, while one partner was actively coding the other was checking for errors testing, and editing for proper structure and efficiency. This helped us get through the project much more efficiently than if one partner was responsible for one single part on their own. We also periodically switched roles and engaged in rubber ducky debugging with one partner acting as the rubber ducky at one point and then switching roles.  

### Learning 

This project helped us learn how to integrate HTML/CSS and Python to produce a specific product. This experience will be invaluable in terms of our final project as we will need to create a similar web app that integrates HTML on the front end and Python on the back end. Chat GPT acted as a debugging tool and a tool we used to sharpen the efficiency of our code, after using it we were able to find multiple errors in our API recall and were able to tackle the issue immediately, without Chat GPT we would have had to search extensively for the issue and we wouldn’t have gotten our work done while learning as well as we did.
