# Assignment 3 Reflection

## Project Overview:

Throughout the development of this project, I felt like all the python skills I learned throughout the semester came together. The assignment was challenging but at the same time one of the most interesting programs I have developed in the class. The program is an application designed for users to input a location and use it to extract the latitude and longitude of that location from MapQuest API. This information is extracted as a JSON file which can be used to then look up the neartes MBTA station in the MBTA API url. The information from MBTA would also be in a JSON format and included more information about the MTBA, like which stations are accessible by wheelchair. Essentially everything is put together using Flask to run the code on the web through some HTML pages. The app is coded to read the input of the user location and then return a results page that has all the information needed about the MTBA station nearest to that location.

## Project Reflection:

I would say that the process behind the development of this app went relatively well. I started by creating the functions that would take the location information and would essentially return what would be the nearest station with information about wheelchair accessibility. These functions were built using previous knowledge of python and JSON files and being able to extract the requested information from them. After being done with the functions I began working on the front end. Essentially taking what we learned from the past weeks and created two HTML pages; One with a form, taking the input of the user, and one to display the output the result. Overall, testing was a constant measure throughout the development of the program. The first tests would be for each function, and going back to see why the output wasn't the desired one in case it did not work. When functiosn were completed, testing was made on the connections between python and HTML to display the intended results on the web. I would say that we were prepared for the development of this assignment. However, with more time and some more self-studying, I would have liked to really be able to implement more features into the program. Things like showing a picture of the station with google maps, or even incorporating directions also through google maps would have been a very cool feature. But overall, this assignment though me very useful skills on APIs and flask that I would definitely consider in my final project.

I worked on this assignment individually. I honestly don't regret working with a partner because I feel like this assignment helped me understand the topics very well by trial and error. I was able to use class examples to guide myself throughout the assignment and be able to complete it. The only reason I would have done the assignment in a team would have been to split more of the work. It was definitely an overwhelming amount of work and I feel like more time and even some help would have allowed me to improve the program to add some new cool features that would have made the app more unique. However, overall I think it went very well and I learned a lot from the assignment.
